# Green Finance Optimization Platform

This project leverages Agentic AI to create an AI-powered platform that optimizes green finance investments. The platform helps financial institutions assess, prioritize, and allocate capital to the most impactful and sustainable projects. It evaluates projects based on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores and risk assessments derived from news articles and research papers.

## Approach

1. *Data Collection*:
   - *Newspapers*: Collect articles from various reputable news sources to gather risk-related data (economic, environmental, social).
   - *arXiv*: Gather academic papers from arXiv focused on sustainability, green finance, and ESG topics to build a knowledge base for model training.

2. *Risk Assessment*:
   - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from newspaper articles. This includes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify risk-related entities, sentiment analysis to gauge risk levels, and topic modeling to classify risks into economic, environmental, and social categories.
   
3. *Risk Scoring*:
   - Develop a risk scoring mechanism based on extracted features, including the frequency of risk mentions, sentiment scores, and urgency levels of the risks. These scores help determine the overall risk of each green finance project.

4. *Machine Learning Models*:
   - *Risk Prediction Model*: A machine learning model is trained on newspaper-derived features to predict the risk level of each green finance project.
   - *ESG Scoring Model*: A separate machine learning model is trained on arXiv data to predict the ESG scores for projects based on predefined sustainability metrics.

5. *Optimization Engine*:
   - The combined risk and ESG scores are fed into an optimization engine that uses techniques like linear programming to allocate resources efficiently while maximizing ESG outcomes and minimizing risks. The goal is to create an optimal portfolio of green finance projects.

6. *Visualization*:
   - The platform provides a dashboard to visualize project rankings, ESG scores, risk levels, and optimized portfolio allocations. The dashboard also supports scenario analysis to explore how different investment strategies affect the overall outcomes.
